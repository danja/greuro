# GREURO

 * The world needs cryprocurrencies
 * The bitcoin network is not suistainable, ["the entire Bitcoin mining network is on par with Ireland for electricity consumption"](http://karlodwyer.github.io/publications/pdf/bitcoin_KJOD_2014.pdf)
 * Value of all bitcoins in circulation: 4x10^9 â‚¬
 * What's backing the value? The computation invested for decentralized transaction validation during the initial period during which new bitcoins are created
 * How expensive are transactions? The proof of work costs  energy, see the paper quote above. 

Scalability improvements in a centralized/federated system

 * Book multiple ownership changes of the same coin in one transaction, till the central authority logs the transaction the value depends on the trust in the intermediaries. If every intermediary can proof the identity of the previous intermediary some trust (also by the possibility of legal enforcement) is probale. In practice a logging of a single transaction by the central authority is only needed if the paying party doesn't reveal their identity.
