# GREURO
## A cheaper and more ecological alternative to Bitcoins

An essential security feature of Bitcoins if the proof of work. Computer solve cryptological puzzles as a proof of work when approving changes into the blockchain. This proof of work is an elegant solution to allow for a decentralized network in an anonymous network. However it brings huge energy costs, the bitcoint network already uses around as much electricity as the republic of Ireland, even though today only a very small fraction of the monetary transactions are bitcoins transactions.

A solution: the GREURO is designed to use a trusted central block chain run by the Greek State. GREUROs are transferable digital certificates than can be converted to EUROs. (Some limitations on how many EUROs can be converted by person and day might be in place).

## How does it work?

Compared with the Bitcon block Chains things are quite easy.

### Generations of new GREUROs

The GREUROs are released by the Greek State, basically its a document digitally signed by the Greek 

    The Hellenic Republic promises to pay the holder of this GREURO the amount of 1 EURO. 
    As holder of this GREURO shall either be the person that can identify as the original 
    holder of this GREURO or any person that can provide cryptographic proof that the 
    orginal holder transferred the rights on this GREURO to them either directly or via 
    the a cryptographically proven transfer chain. The first person presenting as holder 
    of this GREURO shall be considered the legitimate owner, as person subsequently 
    attempting to cash the same GREURO shall be which person in the transfer chain 
    duplicated the GREURO.

    Fineprint: max. transaction fee, possibility of temporary limitations, ....

    Number: 43295873

    Intial Owner {
       Name (optional): Alice.
       Public Key: 7F87 5B8C ........
    }

### Forwarding GREUROS

Now Alice who got the first GREURO wants to use it to pay for a drink and consequently transfer it to Bob. She basically just takes the above document including its signature by the Greek State and add the new owner before signing it with her key (i.e. with the secret key that matches the public key in the owner section of the original document.

    [Signed original document]

    I hereby transfer all my rights on this GREURO to the new owner below. I promise that I only transfer this GREURO to the new owner specified it this document and will not cash the GREURO myself.

    New Owner {
       Name (optional): Bob.
       Public Key: 3D63 Fe45 ........
    }

Bob can now either trust Alice and keep the document as it is, or convert it to to a new GREURO using the online services of the Greek State. Even though the transaction fee to create a brand new GREURO from a transferred one Bob decide not to convert the GREURO. Instead he uses the GREURO to pay one his staff member Carol. The new digitally singed document is quite similar to the above one


    [The document Alice Signed]

    I hereby transfer all my rights on this GREURO to the new owner below. I promise that I only transfer this GREURO to the new owner specified it this document and will not cash the GREURO myself. If any of the earlier parties in the transfer chain have double spent this GREURO I shall reimburs the new owner in full.

    New Owner {
       Name (optional): Carol.
       Public Key: 8D33 567F ........
    }

Carol can either just trust Bob or convert the GREURO for a brand new one with the online service of the Greek State. If nobody double spent Carol will get the bran new GREURO (like the one Bob hat, except with her name on it.




 * The world needs cryprocurrencies
 * The bitcoin network is not substainable, ["the entire Bitcoin mining network is on par with Ireland for electricity consumption"](http://karlodwyer.github.io/publications/pdf/bitcoin_KJOD_2014.pdf)
 * Value of all bitcoins in circulation: 4x10^9 â‚¬
 * What's backing the value? The computation invested for decentralized transaction validation during the initial period during which new bitcoins are created
 * How expensive are transactions? The proof of work costs  energy, see the paper quote above. 

Scalability improvements in a centralized/federated system

 * Book multiple ownership changes of the same coin in one transaction, till the central authority logs the transaction the value depends on the trust in the intermediaries. If every intermediary can proof the identity of the previous intermediary some trust (also by the possibility of legal enforcement) is probale. In practice a logging of a single transaction by the central authority is only needed if the paying party doesn't reveal their identity.
