 * The world needs cryprocurrencies
 * The bitcoin network is not suistainable, ["the entire Bitcoin mining network is on par with Ireland for electricity consumption"](http://karlodwyer.github.io/publications/pdf/bitcoin_KJOD_2014.pdf)

 * What's backing the value? The computation invested for decentralized transaction validation during the initial period during which new bitcoins are created
 * How expensive are transactions? The proof of work costs  energy, see the paper quote above.
