## A cheaper and more ecological alternative to Bitcoins

An essential security feature of Bitcoins if the proof of work. Computer solve cryptological puzzles as a proof of work when approving changes into the blockchain. This proof of work is an elegant solution to allow for a decentralized network in an anonymous network. However it brings huge energy costs.

 * The world needs cryprocurrencies
 * The bitcoin network is not substainable, ["the entire Bitcoin mining network is on par with Ireland for electricity consumption"](http://karlodwyer.github.io/publications/pdf/bitcoin_KJOD_2014.pdf)
 * Value of all bitcoins in circulation: 4x10^9 â‚¬
 * What's backing the value? The computation invested for decentralized transaction validation during the initial period during which new bitcoins are created
 * How expensive are transactions? The proof of work costs  energy, see the paper quote above. 

Scalability improvements in a centralized/federated system

 * Book multiple ownership changes of the same coin in one transaction, till the central authority logs the transaction the value depends on the trust in the intermediaries. If every intermediary can proof the identity of the previous intermediary some trust (also by the possibility of legal enforcement) is probale. In practice a logging of a single transaction by the central authority is only needed if the paying party doesn't reveal their identity.
